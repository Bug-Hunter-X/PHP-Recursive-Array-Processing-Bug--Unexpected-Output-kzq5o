This repository demonstrates a common bug in PHP involving recursive array processing. The function `processData` aims to process a nested array, performing different operations based on the data type of each element.  However, it produces unexpected results due to the recursive call's interaction with string manipulation and array merging. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle these scenarios for reliable output.
